# Source formats

One document per source: what the native format is, where it is
documented, and every finding code its converter reports, with the
mapping behind it. A converter's tests fail on a code its document
does not list.

- [claudecode.md](claudecode.md): Claude Code.
- [pi.md](pi.md): pi.
- [codex.md](codex.md): Codex CLI.

## Codes every converter can report

The shared builder reports these, whatever the source.

| Code | Kind | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agentimport/same-instant` | repaired | Two entries identical in type, body and parent at one instant would be one entry in the session format; the second was moved a nanosecond later. |
| `agentimport/provenance` | gap | The header's `agentimport:source` member records the import; see [incompatibilities](../incompatibilities.md). |
