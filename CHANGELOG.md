## Unreleased

- Added: the `agentimport` package: `Report` (a tally of where every
  native line went and findings by stable code), `Builder` (appends a
  native tree to a session, keeps native IDs in namespaced members,
  records provenance in the `agentimport:source` header member) and
  `CallIDs` (call IDs unique across a session, as the format requires).
